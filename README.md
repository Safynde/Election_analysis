## Election audit Summary
     Using python to automate the election results help save time reduce cost, provide on-demand analysis for future elections, and flexibility. Including voter turnout by county with candidates’ results is another way to take advantage of the convenience and flexibility a script provides. The insights gained during the audit can be a guide for future election performance, in order to allocate resources accordingly.
     The script can be modified to analyze the election at a federal level like the presidential election where the county_ name can be replaced by the state name. Another modification is to add the advertisement cost for each campaign, this will provide more in-depth information on the impact of the money on the outcome of the election. The other modification can be to add the vote breakdown by race, age, and gender, to provide an idea of the demographic of the voter during the election.
